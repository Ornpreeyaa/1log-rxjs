[1log](https://github.com/ivan7237d/1log) plugin for logging RxJS observables. This plugin lets you log more information about what happens to an observable than just nexts, errors, and completions &mdash; for instance, if you subscribe to an observable multiple times, you can tell which subscription a next originates from. It can also be used in combination with Jest's snapshots feature to test observables by creating snapshots of log messages.

Please refer to the [GitHub README](https://github.com/ivan7237d/1log-rxjs) for full documentation.
